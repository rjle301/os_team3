** @brief   Support for dynamic memory allocation within the OS.
**
** This is a basic page allocator. Each allocation request returns
** a pointer to a single 4096-byte page of memory.
**
** The module also supports subddivision of pages into "slices",
** each of which is 1KB (i.e., 1/4 of a page).
